BLOOD BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

OVERVIEW

Aim
The aim of Blood Bank management system is to create a bridge between the demand and supply of blood. To develop a Blood Bank Management System where authorized members can insert and retrieve the blood, plasma and stem cells data from the blood inventory. Record an activity when a donor wills to donate and grant to the recipients when needed.
Phases
•	Conceptual Design
•	Relational Schema
•	Implementation
•	Document & Demo

CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
ASSUMPTIONS AND INSIGHTS
•	Users on the website can be categorized into three, DONORS who donate blood, blood plasma and stem cells according to their possibility, RECIPIENTS are the patients or the customers who obtain the item according to their requirement, and EMPLOYEES who manages the donors and recipients.
•	There are eight main blood types, but some are rarer than others. The list below shows the percentage of donors with each blood type: O positive: 35%, O negative: 13%, A positive: 30%, A negative: 8%, B positive: 8%, B negative: 2%, AB positive: 2%, AB negative: 1%
•	Assigning a Blood Badge to a Donor according to the quantity of blood donated.
•	Based on the filters like Age or Gender, Feedback is retrieved from Recipients.
•	A duplicate record is not allowed for data redundancy.

IMPLEMENTATION

PROCESS OF BUILDING BLOOD BANK DATABASE
Implementation is done in MySQL using SQL statements in the following parts
1.	Relational Schema and setting up the table relationships.
2.	Creation of Database, Tables, Structures, Data Types and Format
3.	Creation of complex queries to perform more accurate searches on a database.
4.	Creation of triggers, stored procedures and functions corresponding to the distinct requirements

FUTURE SCOPE AND CONCLUSION

FUTURE SCOPE:
•	The future implementation will be online help for the customers and chatting with administrator.
•	Enhancing the project adding marketing leads and strategies.
•	In our project we have created a stored function which determines the blood badge of a user. In future, we want to classify even the rare blood donors who doesn't satisfy the blood badge condition of 2 + units' donation as gold.
•	Avoid accumulating blood from individuals who might also be unsuitable due to the threat of health factors that might harm the patients.

CONCLUSION:
The main purpose is to bring the donor and the patient in a common platform. This should encourage new donors and retain old donors to donate blood.
